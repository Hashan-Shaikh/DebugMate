# DebugMate

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered coding assistant built using **FastAPI** and **Next.js**. It leverages the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** concept to assist developers with debugging and resolving coding issues across various programming languages. The assistant creates a **Pinecone** vector database and integrates with the **Groq API** for **Llama 3-8B** model, enabling efficient code assistance.

## Features
- **Coding Debugging**: Helps identify and fix coding issues in multiple programming languages.
- **Vector Database**: Creates and manages a Pinecone vector database to store relevant code snippets and solutions.
- **Llama 3-8B Integration**: Uses Groq API to call Llama 3-8B for AI-driven code assistance.
- **RAG Concept**: Combines retrieval of code examples with generative AI for accurate and efficient debugging.

## Tech Stack
- **FastAPI**: Backend API for handling requests and responses.
- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for building the UI and managing interactions.
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for storing and retrieving code-related information.
- **Groq API**: Integration for using Llama 3-8B for AI-based code debugging.
